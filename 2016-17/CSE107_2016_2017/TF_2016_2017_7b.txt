Inline functions are functions that are not actually called but, rather, are expanded in line at
the point of each call. The inline specifier is a request not a command to the compiler. 


Advantages:
1. Have no overhead of the function call and return mechanism
2. Can be Executed much faster than normal function
3. Safer than parameterized macros

Disadvantages:
1. If they are too large and are called too often then the program grows larger
