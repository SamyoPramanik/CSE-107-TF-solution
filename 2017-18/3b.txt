What is a type wrapper? Name any three type wrappers. Why are type wrappers needed?
    Answer:
        Type wrapper is a class whose objects which are used to encapsualte the corresponding primitive type.
        
        Three type wrappers are:
            1. Integer
            2. Character
            3. Boolean

        We can’t pass a primitive type by reference to a method.
        Also many of the standard data structures implemented by Java operate on objects, which means that you can’t use these data structures to store primitive types
        So, we need type wrappers to pass primitive types by reference to a method and to store primitive types in data structures.
