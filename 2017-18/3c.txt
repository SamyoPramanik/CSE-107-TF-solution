Explain briefly dynamic method dispatching.
    Dynamic method dispatch is a concept in object-oriented programming where the method 
    executed is determined at runtime based on the actual object type. 
    It allows subclasses to provide their own method implementation. 
    This is achieved through method overriding and polymorphism, offering flexibility and extensibility in the code.
