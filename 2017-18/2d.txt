    What are the advantages of multithreading over process based multitasking?
    
    Answer:
        The advantages of multithreading over process-based multitasking in a more concise form:
            Efficiency: Threads are lighter and faster to create than processes.
            Resource Sharing: Threads easily share data and resources.
            Responsiveness: Multithreading keeps applications responsive.
            Resource Utilization: Threads maximize CPU and resource use.
            Simplified Communication: Threads communicate efficiently.
            Modularity: Promotes organized and modular code.
            Scalability: Easily adjust the number of threads.
            Faster Context Switching: Threads switch context more quickly.
            Low Overhead: Less overhead for thread management.
            Real-time Processing: Ideal for real-time and event-driven tasks.
