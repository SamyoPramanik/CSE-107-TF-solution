This is the complete solution set of this year.
Re-uploaded for more convenient browsing.
Also would recommend checking up the Question 4 and 6 specially.
Also all the java codes are written for a single common class namely "solve". So you can just copy paste the code from here in java file named "solve.java" and work around with all the codes without hassle.
Thank you.
