Why virtual base classes are used?
Give an example of a class hierarchy where we must use virtual base class to avoid ambiguity. You do not need to write code.
    
    Virtual Base Class prevents a derived class to inherit more than one copy of the base class
    This may happen when a derived class directly inherits two base classes and these base classes are also derived from another common base class
    In this case, the derived class will have two copies of the common base class, which is not recommended
    To avoid this problem, we make the base class virtual so that only one copy is inherited
    
    Example:
        class A
        {
            public:
                int a;
        };
        class B : virtual public A
        {
            public:
                int b;
        };
        class C : virtual public A
        {
            public:
                int c;
        };
        class D : public B, public C
        {
            public:
                int d;
        };
        int main()
        {
            D obj;
            obj.a = 10; // Would have had collision if virtual weren't used
            return 0;
        }
