Consider the following function declaration
        void fl(int a=l, int b);
Is this a valid declaration?
If yes, then what does it mean? If no, then what is the problem?

Answer:
    This is not a valid declaration.
    While specifying non-default values, we have to start from the leftmost
    parameter and move to the right one by one. Since non-default value b is in the right of default values a it will cause ambiguity and thus error.
