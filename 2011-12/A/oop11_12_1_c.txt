A reference is an implicit pointer which acts like another name for a variable.
Unlike pointers, once a reference becomes associated with a variable, it cannot refer to other variables

References used in c++ programming in 3 ways:
i.A reference can be passed to a function
ii.A reference can be returned by a function
iii.An independent reference can be created
