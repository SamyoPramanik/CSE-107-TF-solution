Static variables and methods in Java have specific properties:

Properties of Static Variables:

Static variables are also known as class variables.
They are associated with the class itself, not with instances of the class.
There is only one copy of a static variable shared among all instances of the class.
Static variables are initialized only once, typically when the class is loaded.
They are accessed using the class name, e.g., ClassName.staticVariable.
Properties of Static Methods:

Static methods belong to the class and not to any particular instance.
They can be called using the class name, e.g., ClassName.staticMethod().
Static methods cannot access or modify instance-specific data (non-static members) directly.
They are often used for utility functions, such as mathematical calculations or helper methods that don't require access to instance-specific data.
Now, let's explain dynamic method dispatch with an example in Java:

Dynamic Method Dispatch is a mechanism in Java where the method that gets called on an object is determined at runtime, based on the actual type of the object. It's a fundamental concept in polymorphism.

Example:

java
Copy code
class Animal {
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    @Override
    void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal myAnimal1 = new Dog();
        Animal myAnimal2 = new Cat();

        myAnimal1.makeSound(); // Calls Dog's makeSound() at runtime
        myAnimal2.makeSound(); // Calls Cat's makeSound() at runtime
    }
}
In this example, we have an Animal class with a method makeSound(). 
We also have two subclasses, Dog and Cat, each of which overrides the makeSound() method. 
In the main method, we create objects of both Dog and Cat but assign them to references of type Animal.

At runtime, when we call myAnimal1.makeSound(), it calls Dog's makeSound() method because myAnimal1 
refers to a Dog object. Similarly, when we call myAnimal2.makeSound(), it calls Cat's makeSound() 
method because myAnimal2 refers to a Cat object. This is dynamic method dispatch in action, where 
the appropriate method is determined based on the actual type of the object at runtime, allowing for 
polymorphic behavior.
