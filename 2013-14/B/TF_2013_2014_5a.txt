Certainly, let's continue with the differences between String and StringBuffer in Java:

Mutability:

String: Strings in Java are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify a string actually creates a new string with the modified content.
StringBuffer: StringBuffer is mutable, which means you can modify the contents of a StringBuffer object without creating a new one.
Performance:

String: Because strings are immutable, performing operations like concatenation results in the creation of new string objects. This can be inefficient when dealing with a large number of string modifications.
StringBuffer: StringBuffer is designed for efficient string manipulation. It allows you to modify the content of a string without creating new objects, making it more suitable for building or modifying strings in a loop or other performance-critical scenarios.
Synchronization:

String: String objects are inherently thread-safe because they are immutable. Multiple threads can safely access and share string objects without the need for synchronization.
StringBuffer: StringBuffer is designed to be thread-safe through the use of synchronized methods. This means that when multiple threads access the same StringBuffer object, they are synchronized, ensuring data consistency. However, this synchronization can introduce some performance overhead.
Usage:

String: Use strings when you need a constant and unchangeable sequence of characters. Strings are ideal for representing things like names, addresses, and other values that should not change.
StringBuffer: Use StringBuffer when you need to perform a series of string modifications, especially within a multi-threaded environment where synchronization is necessary. StringBuffer is efficient for building or modifying strings dynamically.
In summary, the choice between String and StringBuffer depends on your specific use case. If you need a mutable string and anticipate frequent modifications, StringBuffer is a better choice due to its efficiency. If immutability is required or if you're working with single-threaded scenarios, then using String is appropriate. Additionally, in modern Java, you may also consider using StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer for better performance in single-threaded scenarios, as StringBuilder is not synchronized.
