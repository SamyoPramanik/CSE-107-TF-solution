In Java, multiple inheritance, which is the ability for a class to inherit from more than one class, 
is not supported for classes. However, it can be achieved through interfaces and limited multiple
 inheritance for one class and multiple interfaces. Here's how it works:

Single Inheritance for Classes:

In Java, a class can inherit from only one class (single inheritance). This means that a class 
can have at most one direct superclass.
java
Copy code
class Parent {
    // ...
}

class Child extends Parent {
    // ...
}
Multiple Inheritance for Interfaces:

Java allows a class to implement multiple interfaces. This is the way Java achieves multiple inheritance 
of behavior.
java
Copy code
interface InterfaceA {
    void methodA();
}

interface InterfaceB {
    void methodB();
}

class MyClass implements InterfaceA, InterfaceB {
    public void methodA() {
        // Implementation for methodA
    }

    public void methodB() {
        // Implementation for methodB
    }
}
In this example, MyClass implements both InterfaceA and InterfaceB, effectively inheriting behavior 
from both interfaces.

Regarding abstract classes in Java:

An abstract class in Java can be declared as final. When an abstract class is marked as final, it means that 
it cannot be subclassed. This effectively prevents any further inheritance from that abstract class.
However, it's important to note that an abstract class that is marked as final cannot be extended or 
subclassed by any other class. This is in contrast to non-abstract classes, which can be marked as final 
to prevent subclassing but can also be instantiated directly.
