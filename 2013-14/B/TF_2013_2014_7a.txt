In Java, when you declare a variable in a class with the "protected" access modifier versus declaring 
it with no modifier (default access), there are significant differences in terms of visibility and access:

Protected Access Modifier:

Variables declared with the "protected" access modifier are accessible within the same package and also 
in subclasses (regardless of whether they are in the same package or not).
This means that a protected variable can be accessed within the class it is declared in, all classes 
within the same package, and any subclasses of the class, whether they are in the same package or not.
Example:
java
Copy code
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    protected int protectedVar;
}
No Modifier (Default Access):

Variables declared with no access modifier (default access) are accessible only within the same package.
They are not accessible outside the package, even if a subclass in a different package tries to access them.
Example:
java
Copy code
package mypackage;

public class MyClass {
    int defaultVar;
}
In summary, the key difference is in the scope of visibility:

"protected" variables have broader visibility, accessible within the same package and in subclasses 
(both within and outside the package).
Variables with no modifier (default access) are accessible only within the same package and are not 
visible outside the package, even in subclasses.
